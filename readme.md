## What?
This tool can load ESHER (https://escher.github.io/#/) JSON maps and ESHER-ready JSON Models created using COBRA (https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/index.html) to allow for easy semi-automatic visiualization and editing of (small) network maps, which subsequently can be saved as ESHER-ready maps and further explored within ESCHER.

## Why? 
At the department where I contributed to a project, we have several methods of creating submodels of larger metabolic networks. These submodels need to be explored to validate and verify their usefulness, normally done in ESCHER. This method is tedious and requires substantial time investment, therefore I thought it would be an interesting project to create an initial visualization tool in which users can (approximately) create the required network with only a few clicks of the mouse. Once acceptable, this can then be further loaded into ESCHER (as it is a lot prettier).
